> # Data Statement - Version 2

> **How to use this document:**
> Fill in each section according to the instructions. The goal is to help people understand your data when they approach it. This could be someone looking at it in ten years, or it could be you yourself looking back at the data in two years.

> For full details, see the How To Guide(LINK).

> Instruction fields are given as blockquotes; delete the instructions when you're done, and provide the file with your data, for example as "DATASTATEMENT.md". The lists in some blocks are designed to be filled in, but it's good to also leave a written description of what's happening, as well as the list.

> Only blockquoted content should be deleted; the final about statement should be left intact.
 
# Data Statement for [Dataset Name]

## A. HEADER

> The header should include the following: 

* Dataset title
* Dataset curator(s) [name, affiliation]
* Dataset version (including date)
* Dataset citation
* Data statement author(s) [name, affiliation]
* Data statement version (including date)
* Data statement citation

## B. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

> The executive summary is a short (60–100 word) summary of the data statement that at a minimum should include: (1) a one-sentence description of the curation rationale, (2) the language(s), and (3) an overview of relevant quantitative information such as the dataset size. 

## C. CURATION RATIONALE 

> The curation rationale should answer questions including: Why was this dataset created? What is the task or research question the dataset is intended to address? Which texts were included and what were the goals in selecting texts, both in the original collection and in any further sub-selection?

## D. DOCUMENTATION FOR SOURCE DATASETS

> For datasets built out of pre-existing datasets, a link to a data statement for each source dataset should be included. If a data statement is not available, provide a link to a publication or other documentation.

## E. LANGUAGE VARIETIES

> All of the languages and language varieties represented in the dataset should be characterized with (1) a language tag from BCP-47 identifying the language variety (e.g., en-US or yue-Hant-HK), and (2) a prose description elucidating and elaborating on the BCP-47 tag (e.g., English as spoken in Palo Alto, California; Cantonese written with traditional characters by speakers in Hong Kong who are bilingual in Mandarin).

## F. SPEAKER DEMOGRAPHIC

> All of the speaker groups represented in the dataset should be characterized with a prose description. Demographic categories are culture-specific and locally appropriate categories and definitions should be used. Suggested specifications include: 

* Age
* Gender
* Race/ethnicity
* Socioeconomic status
* First language(s)
* Proficiency in the language(s) of the data
* Number of different speakers represented
* Presence of disordered speech
 
## G. ANNOTATOR DEMOGRAPHIC

> All of the annotator groups represented in the dataset, including those who developed the guidelines, should be characterized with a prose description. Demographic categories are context- and culture-specific; therefore, locally appropriate categories and definitions should be used. Suggested specifications include:

* Age
* Gender
* Race/ethnicity
* Socioeconomic status
* First language(s)
* Proficiency in the language(s) of the data being annotated
* Number of different annotators represented
* Relevant training

## H. SPEECH SITUATION AND TEXT CHARACTERISTICS

> A description of speech situation in which the linguistic production occurred and/or the relevant text characteristics should be provided. This schema element may also be used to describe the cultural context of the language practices collected. Specifications include:

* Time and place of linguistic activity
* Date(s) of data collection
* Modality (spoken, signed, written)
* Scripted/edited vs. spontaneous
* Synchronous (e.g., in-person or live online chatting) vs. asynchronous (e.g., letters, emails, forums) interaction 
* Speakers’ intended audience
* Genre (e.g., newswire vs. social media)
* Topic (e.g., entertainment vs. natural disaster)
* Non-linguistic context (e.g., photos speakers were all looking at; a game participants are playing)
* Additional details about the cultural context (optional)

## I. PREPROCESSING AND DATA FORMATTING

> A description of all preprocessing and data formatting modifications made to the data (except for annotations) should be provided, including information about any anonymization procedures. The description should also specify which, if any, tools were used to make the modifications. 

## J. CAPTURE QUALITY

> A description of quality issues in data capture should be provided. This includes all types of quality issues that arise across a broad range of collection methodologies for capturing an otherwise impermanent event.

## K. LIMITATIONS

> For any challenges that could not be fully addressed, a description of those challenges and characterization of the resulting limitations of the dataset should be provided.

## L. METADATA

> A collection of pointers to relevant metadata should be provided. Suggestions include:

* Link to the license/copyright permissions for use or modification of the dataset
* Link to the published or online guidelines that annotators used to annotate the data
* Link to documentation providing metadata about the annotation process, including protections for annotator anonymity, how annotators were compensated, and which aspects of the annotation were produced automatically
* Metrics for inter-annotator agreement and/or other numerical scores of dataset quality

## M. DISCLOSURES AND ETHICAL REVIEW

> For projects supported by funding, a description of the funding source for the dataset and relevant information (e.g., grant number) should be specified. For projects that went through an ethical approval process, a link to the institution (e.g., IRB) and a brief description of the consent process should be provided. Any potential conflicts of interest should also be disclosed.

## N. OTHER

> Any further considerations that are relevant for the dataset should be included here. 

## O. GLOSSARY

> A list of terms and associated definitions that may be technical or unfamiliar to nonexperts should be provided.

> ## About this document

> A data statement is a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize, how software might be appropriately deployed, and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software.
