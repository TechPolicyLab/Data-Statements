> # Data Statement - Version 3
>
> ## About data statements and this template
>
> A data statement is a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize, how software might be appropriately deployed, and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software. In developing and writing your data statement, keep in mind that someone new to your dataset might be reading your data statement 10 or 20 years from now. Alternatively, at some point in the future, you might find yourself looking back at your data and reading your data statement to recall key characteristics and decisions.
>
> We encourage dataset developers to use data statements to guide dataset development, as well as to create effective documentation. The schema elements are written so that they may be interpreted both as future-looking questions during dataset design and as questions about the current state of the dataset when users are accessing a completed dataset. For dataset developers who are engaged in community-driven dataset projects, consider using the C3DAR toolkit, available at https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/50585.

> ## How to use this document
>
> Fill in each section according to the instructions. The goal is to help people understand your data when they approach it. This could be someone looking at it in ten years, or it could be you yourself looking back at the data in two years.

> For full details, see [Creating and Documenting Language Datasets with Data Statements](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/data-statements/).
>
> Instruction fields are given as blockquotes; delete the instructions when you're done, and provide the file with your data, for example as "DATASTATEMENT.md". The lists in some schema elements are designed to be filled in, but it's good to also provide a written description, as well as the list.

## 3 CURATION RATIONALE 

> The curation rationale should provide answers to questions including the following, to be interpreted both as future-looking prompts for dataset design and informational questions from users of completed datasets: What is the intended purpose of this dataset? What is the task or research question the dataset is intended to address? What texts are included and what are the goals for selecting them? What is the internal organization of the dataset? What constitutes a data instance?

## 4 DOCUMENTATION FOR SOURCE DATASETS

> For datasets built out of other pre-existing datasets, a link to a data statement for each source dataset should be included. If a data statement is not available, provide a link to a publication or other documentation. Provide links to licenses, copyright, or terms of use for source datasets, where applicable.

## 5 LANGUAGE VARIETIES

> All of the languages and language varieties represented in the dataset should be characterized with (1) a language tag from [BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) identifying the language variety (e.g., en-US or yue-Hant-HK), and (2) a prose description elucidating and elaborating on the BCP-47 tag (e.g., English as spoken in Palo Alto, California; Cantonese written with traditional characters by speakers in Hong Kong who are bilingual in Mandarin; French Sign Language as used in Marseille, France).

## 6 LANGUAGE USER DEMOGRAPHIC

> All of the language user groups represented in the dataset should be characterized with a prose description. Demographic categories are context- and culture-specific; therefore, locally appropriate categories and definitions should be used as determined by the community. Suggested specifications include:

* Age
* Gender
* Race/ethnicity
* Socioeconomic status
* First language(s)
* Proficiency in the language(s) of the data
* Number of different language users represented
* Presence of disordered speech or sign
 
## 7 ANNOTATOR DEMOGRAPHIC

> All of the annotator groups represented in the dataset, including those who developed the guidelines, should be characterized with a prose description. Demographic categories are context- and culture-specific; therefore, locally appropriate categories and definitions should be used. Suggested specifications include:

* Age
* Gender
* Race/ethnicity
* Socioeconomic status
* First language(s)
* Proficiency in the language(s) of the data being annotated
* Number of different annotators represented
* Relevant training

## 8 LINGUISTIC SITUATION AND TEXT CHARACTERISTICS

> A description of the situation in which the linguistic production occurred and/or the relevant text characteristics should be provided. This schema element may also be used to describe the cultural context of the language practices collected. Suggested specifications include:

* Time and place of linguistic activity
* Date(s) of data collection
* Modality `(spoken, signed, written)`
* Scripted/edited vs. spontaneous
* Synchronous `(e.g., in-person or live online chatting)` vs. asynchronous `(e.g., letters, emails, forums)` interaction 
* Language users’ intended audience
* Genre `(e.g., newswire or social media)`
* Topic `(e.g., entertainment or natural disaster)`
* Non-linguistic context `(e.g., photos participants were all looking at; a game participants are playing)`
* Any additional details about the cultural context 

## 9 PREPROCESSING AND DATA FORMATTING

> A description of all preprocessing and data formatting modifications made to the data (except for annotations) should be provided, including information about any anonymization procedures. The description should also specify any tools used to make the modifications and whether the raw data is included in the dataset. 

## 10 CAPTURE QUALITY

> A description of quality issues in data capture should be provided. This includes all types of quality issues that arise across a broad range of collection methodologies for capturing an otherwise impermanent event.

## 11 LIMITATIONS

> For any challenges not fully addressed, a description of those challenges and characterization of the resulting limitations of the dataset should be provided.

## 12 METADATA

> A collection of pointers to relevant metadata should be provided. Suggestions include:

A data statement is a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize, how software might be appropriately deployed, and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software.

This data statement was written based on the template for the Data Statements Version 3 schema. The template was prepared by Angelina McMillan-Major and Emily M. Bender and can be found at https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/data-statements/ and was updated from the community [Version 1 Markdown template by Leon Dercyznski](https://gist.github.com/leondz/b3a53bb807a301424e3762787a04a5da).
